emacsc(1) is a wrapper of emacsclient(1) for use within a terminal,
and emacsc.el is a tiny little tweak to the server module to help
emacsc(1) interact with the running Emacs.

This package contains some scripts in the `bin' directory, so
install them manually into a directory in your path.  For example,
dired(1) opens a directory with dired, magit(1) opens a directory
with magit-status, ediff(1) is a diff(1) like tool to invoke
ediff-files, and so on.
